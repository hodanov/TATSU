# TATSU

> Rise. Protect Your Circulation.

TATSU is a minimalist macOS app that reminds you to stand up regularly.

It was born from a simple problem:
Sitting too long damages your body.

This app focuses on one thing only:

**Interrupt static pressure.**

---

## Why TATSU?

Modern life keeps us seated.

- Long coding sessions
- Remote work
- Endless meetings
- Deep focus blocks

Prolonged sitting reduces circulation and increases physical stress,
especially in the lower body.

TATSU exists to gently break that inertia.

Stand.
Restore blood flow.
Reset your posture.
Continue.

---

## Philosophy

TATSU is built around a simple idea:

**Standing is not a fitness action.
It is a reset.**

No gamification.
No calorie tracking.
No noise.

Just a quiet reminder to rise.

---

## Features

- ⏱ Configurable stand interval
- 🔔 Native macOS notification support
- 🧘 Minimalist Zen-inspired design
- 🐉 Subtle symbolic visuals (Enso × Rising line)

---

## Design Concept

The icon represents:

- Circle = Stillness / Pressure
- Vertical line = Rise / Release

Black background × Thin white line.

Minimal. Intentional. Focused.

---

## Who is this for?

- Developers
- Remote workers
- Deep-focus professionals
- Anyone who sits too long

---
